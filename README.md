SimpleEpub2
===========

SimpleEpub is a multi-threading windows application that converts a plain text file into an EPUB book. It extracts book name, author name, introduction automatically. It uses Regex to determine chapter titles and converts the text file into several HTML files, one for each chapter. It then zips all the HTML files and other meta files together to generate an EPUB file. SimpleEpub strictly follows all the detailed rules of EPUB files, so that all the EPUB files generated can pass the EPUB validation check online.
